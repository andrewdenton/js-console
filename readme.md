**JavaScript Console Debugging Demo**

A simple demo showing some lesser well-known JavaScript debugging techniques. This code makes use of the excellent prism.js for showing code snippets in HTML with a few custom tweaks.

The demo covers :-

- Using `console.table` to generate formatted output for objects and arrays.
- Simple tips around the Chrome Live debugging issue.
- Structured logging using groups.
- Timings using `console.time()`.
- Using `console.trace()` to get an instant call stack without the need for multiple console.logs across functions.
- Conditional logging using `console.assert()`.
- How to use CSS in `console.log()` with a slightly ridiculous demo.
